Hi there! 👋

 
I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Software Development. I have experience in Python, particularly in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and I’ve been learning C# with a focus on ASP.NET Core for the past six months.  
Through small projects and hands-on training, I've grown closer to real-world challenges in the tech world.  
🎯 My goal is to build smart, optimized, and scalable applications—whether on the web or within machine learning layers.  
📚 I'm always eager to learn and connect with fellow developers and AI enthusiasts.

🛠️ Technologies I've worked with or am currently learning:  
Python | scikit-learn | TensorFlow | C# | ASP.NET Core | SQL

📬 Feel free to explore my projects or reach out—I'd love to collaborate and exchange ideas!
